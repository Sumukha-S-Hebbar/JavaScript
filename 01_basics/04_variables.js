var c=10
// var has been depreciated because it doesnt follow scope

const a= 10
// for constant values

let b= 10; 
// we can use semi colon its not a must 

abc = "sumukha"
//a variable can also be dicalred like this but this is not suggested

let sumukha
//here if i console log sumukha it will we undefined as it is not defined yet

console.table([a,b])
//this will give output in the form of table(index-values) and in this "a" is first so the index of a will be "0"
