//first thing is we will get the window
console.log(Window);
//then inside the window we will get document
console.log(Window.document);
//we can also give it as 
console.log(document)
//if we want other properties of documents then we can use
console.dir(document)
//we can select the elements in different ways 
document.getElementById()
document.getElementsByClassName()
//while writing html we write calss but it is read as classname by document
//then after getting the element we can get the attributes
document.getElementById().getAttribute()
// document.getElementById().setAttribute(attribute name,attribute value)
//the above thing will overwrite
//there are differneces between innerHTML, innerText, TextContent
//innerHTML will give the tags inside
//innerText will display only the text that is visible
//TextContent will display all the content inisde except tags 
//queryselector
//queryselector all
